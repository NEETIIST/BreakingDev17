	//Volunteer FAQs
	"vol_faq_1": "BreakingDev's most frequently asked questions",
	"vol_faq_2_q": "Why the need for volunteers in BreakingDev?",
	"vol_faq_2_a": "There are two main reasons: first because there are people that would like to be part of an hackathon but for several reasons can’t/don’t want to participate as a member of a team. This way we give the opportunity for these people to join the spirit of this type of event. The second reason is because sometimes the organization team needs help in several tasks and this help, from wherever it comes, is always welcome.",
	"vol_faq_3_q": "How can I join the team of volunteers of BreakingDev?",
	"vol_faq_3_a": "To join the team you must create an account and apply for volunteer.",
	"vol_faq_4_q": "What are the tasks of a volunteer in BreakingDev?",
	"vol_faq_4_a_1": "- Orientation of participants in the event venue,",
	"vol_faq_4_a_2": "- Announcements/notices that are necessary for each of the teams,",
	"vol_faq_4_a_3": "- Preparation and distribution of food in the designated areas for meals,",
	"vol_faq_4_a_4": "- Cleanings that may have to be made, not only in the area reserved for meals, but also in the main enclosure of the event,",
	"vol_faq_4_a_5": "- Respond to any doubts that the participants put during the course of the event,",
	"vol_faq_4_a_6": "- Have fun, meet new people, get to know the campus (for those who don’t already know) and also the possibility to, in moments when you are not occupied with any of the previous points and if you want, make contact the members of the companies (our sponsors) that will be event.",
	"vol_faq_5_q": "What am I entitled to as a volunteer in BreakingDev?",
	"vol_faq_5_a": "All volunteers have access to all the meals of the day in which they are active in one shift at least. Besides that, a T-Shirt will be provided to them and they must use it while in the event. Finally they will be rewarded with a certificate of participation as a volunteer signed by the president of NEETI (Students Branch of Telecommunication and Computer Science).",
	"vol_faq_6_q": "Do I need to be in BreakingDev all 48h?",
	"vol_faq_6_a": "Volunteers will be distributed in shifts, each volunteer upon enrollment will have to indicate their availability through these shifts and when the enrollment period ends the organization will assign the shifts to all candidates taking into account the availability of each one.",

	"vol_faq_7_a": "All volunteers can remain the time they wish in the event as long as they are active at least in one shift.",
	"vol_faq_8_q": "I’ve applied for one shift but I’m not sure if I can make the whole time of it. What should I do?",
	"vol_faq_8_a": "This issue must be handled with the volunteer’s coordinator who will present himself as soon as the volunteers application period ends.",
	"vol_faq_9_q": "Is there anything else important for me to know?",
	"vol_faq_9_a": "Yes. During the last shift (Sunday from 3pm to 8pm) we will have the teams presentations, prizes delivery and, finally, the cleaning of the enclosure. We urge all volunteers to apply to be available to attend this shift so they can participate in all these activities, as well as to ensure that the cleaning process is made as fast as possible and also for a team dinner (organization + volunteers) that will be held at the end of everything being minimally tidy.",
	"vol_faq_10_q": "I have a doubt that is not in this FAQ!",
